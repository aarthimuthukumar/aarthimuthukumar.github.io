                    At my high school, every student in the Medical Technology and Health Science Academy
                    is required to write a thesis paper or research paper on the topic of their choice. This research
                    project took me two years, and I conducted my research on solar cells and their implementations in 
                    developing countries. The specific focus of this project was to create affordable, low cost solar cookers
                    for people in developing countries. Globally, more than 33% of the population is exposed to carbon dioxide emissions
                    due to cooking over fires. This is extremely hazardous, and this research project sought to find a solution
                    through the implementation of solar immersion heaters.
                    Most of this research was conducted at California Polytechnic University, under the guidance 
                    of the Physics Department. However, outside of the university setting, I was able to develop a solar cooker that cost lest than a $2
                    to build and costed $0.70. Commericially, these heaters cost around $15, and even more in developing countries. 
                    I also analyzed the sociological impact on countries that would potentially be able to implement this technology. 
                    I am currently writing a research paper for my junior thesis. For more information on this research, feel free to
                    contact me <a href="mailto:aarthimuthukumar1@gmail.com">here</a>.
